<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Kartik Verma, a recent B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering
  graduate from Arya College of Engineering and IT, Jaipur. With a strong
  foundation in programming using C++, frontend development technologies (HTML,
  CSS, ReactJS), and data structures, I am eager to apply my skills and
  contribute to innovative projects. My passion for technology is further
  evidenced by my Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) certification.

<p>
  My hands-on experience includes developing a Discord Chat Bot and a dynamic
  weather application using Python. I've also delved into AI, creating a face
  detection application. My technical expertise extends to SQL for database
  interaction and a working knowledge of the Linux environment. My AMCAT
  Employability Test Certificate further demonstrates my readiness for a
  professional setting.

<p>
  Beyond the classroom and coding, I'm a well-rounded individual. My National
  Gold Medal in Roll Ball showcases my dedication and competitive spirit. My
  leadership abilities have shone through organizing events like the Freshers
  Party. Adaptability is my strength, making me a fast learner, team player, and
  an asset to any organization seeking a driven tech professional.
